ister is a template based installer for linux

Ister aims to be pylint and pep8 clean. New code should verify both pass without
exception before being submitted. If a new exception makes sense it can be added
on a case by case basis.

Testing is supported through tests/ister_test.py.

Currently requires netifaces and python3.
